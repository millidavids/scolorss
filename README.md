# SColorSS

Define a single color, `$sc-primary`, to generate multiple color schemes(complementary, triadic, tetradic, etc...).

All colors come with lightened and darkened variables in 10 degree increments from 10-90 percentages. Just add `-lighten-{degree}` to the end of the variable for lightened colors. similar with darken, but add the word darken instead.
